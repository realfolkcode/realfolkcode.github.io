Hi! I am an average ML, math and music enjoyer. Since I like all these things, I try to combine
them in my PhD research. My personal research interests include audio generative models, methods of
style transfer and human-computer interaction. One of my dream projects is replicating the timbre
of musical instruments to allow a seemless, theremin-like performing. Previously, I had been conducting research on graphs, e.g., network convexity, molecular property prediction, anomaly detection and graph generation.

I am also an amateur musician. I've been playing guitar for over ten years now, with a particular focus on "fingerstyle". The part I like the most about my hobby is arranging multiple voice lines for one guitar. It has elements of solving a puzzle: coming up with optimal finger positions, finding a compromise, leveraging alternate tunings and employing unorthodox techniques.

I hope to write more about ML and my hobby. Stay tuned :)
